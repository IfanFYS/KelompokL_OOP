# ***Persona: Wrath of Nyx - Kelompok L OOP Senin 📌***

## **Hey There! 👋**

### ***Welcome to Group L's repository! In here, you will find our game development project that serves as our post-midterms assignment for our OOP class.***

## **🔍 Overview 🔍**
- ### Project Description:
**Persona: Wrath of Nyx** is a game development project in the Role-Playing Game (RPG) genre developed by our team, Group L, as a post-midterm assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The game is inspired by the popular *Dark Souls* series, offering a challenging experience with a deep storyline and fairly complex game mechanics. This game is created using the `C#` programming language and is designed to be played through a text-based interface in the terminal using a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
- ### Project Objective:
This aim of this project is:
1. Apply the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) into a structured and systematic development project.
2. Develop and implement core features found in a command-line-based RPG game.
3. Document the development process in the form of a video and a written report that explains the technical implementation and the logical flow of the designed code.

## **⚔️ Gameplay ⚔️**
The core gameplay of this project includes:
- **Combat Mechanism:** Utilizing a turn-based combat system where each action has varying success rates, introducing an element of unpredictability in battles.
- **World Exploration:** Players can explore a vast world with various locations, such as the Nyx Palace, cave areas on the map, and mysterious barren lands. Each location features unique points of interest, including enemies, items, or distinct interactions.
- **Interaction with Environment and Enemies**: Players can battle enemies, collect items, and unlock new paths leading to their ultimate objective. Additionally, features like random encounters add challenges during exploration, making the gameplay less repetitive.

## **⚒️ Mechanics ⚒️**
Here is a summary of the mechanics in our project:
- **Character Movement:** The player character can move between areas using a text-based exploration system. Players select actions by choosing numbers corresponding to options in the interface.
- **Interaction with Objects and Enemies:** Players can access the inventory to view and equip weapons, armor, or use healing items during battles or exploration.
- **Item and Summon Usage:** The inventory system allows players to use tools like healing potions or summon allies from hell, which are acquired by collecting fragments of Thanatos' power.
- **Level-Up System:** XP in the form of Tartarus Essence is used to level up the character, enhancing player stats such as attack power, defense, and maximum health.
